# Welcome to the Forecast APP

In this project main goal is forecasting with 4 methods. Those methods are:
- Regression Analysis
- Deseasonalized Regression Analysis
- Exponential Smoothing
- Double Exponential Smoothing.

# Files and Running

You must clone this project to your computer and run the Main class with java.

## Instructions

When you run the code you will see a message that asks you what you want to do.
You must type the number of transaction that you want.  

## Forecasts

If you type one of the number of forecast methods you will see all forecast numbers and their MSE(Mean Squared Errors). Lower the MSE means better the 
prediction.


### Update

I will update the errors and bugs when I have the time for this project. Thanks for your patience and understanding.
